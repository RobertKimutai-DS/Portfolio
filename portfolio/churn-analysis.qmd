# ⚡ Churn Prediction in the Energy Sector (BCG Internship)

![Churn Model Dashboard](../assets/images/churn_dashboard.jpg){.img-fluid .rounded .shadow-sm .mb-4}

During my internship with the **Boston Consulting Group (BCG)**, I led the development of a robust **churn prediction framework** for an energy service provider. The objective was to identify high-risk customers and enable proactive, data-driven retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The energy sector faces increasing competition and shifting customer expectations. A rising churn rate posed a threat to customer lifetime value and operational costs. The challenge was to:

- Detect customers likely to churn  
- Understand *why* they churn  
- Enable actionable business strategies for retention  

---

## 🔍 Data & Features

The dataset consisted of over **10,000 anonymized customer records** across 12 months, with features such as:

- 📆 Price history (monthly pricing plans)  
- 📞 Service interaction logs  
- ⚡ Energy preference (clean vs. conventional)  
- 🏷️ Demographics and usage behavior  
- ⏱️ Tenure and contract type  

> I engineered **54 features** after preprocessing, including volatility metrics, service score deltas, and churn flags.

## 🧠 Modeling Approach

**Tools used**: R, `tidymodels`, `xgboost`, `vip`, `ggstatsplot`, `yardstick`

**Workflow**:

- Data preprocessing with `recipes`  
- Stratified train/test split using `rsample`  
- Model tuning with `tune_grid` and 5-fold CV  
- Model interpretation with `vip`, `DALEX`  

**Top model**: `xgboost` (AUC = 0.91)

## 💡 Key Business Insights

- 🎯 **Volatility in pricing** was a top predictor of churn.  
- 🚫 Customers with **inconsistent service touchpoints** showed higher churn risk.  
- 🌱 Customers preferring **clean energy** had lower churn probability, suggesting an opportunity for sustainability-aligned marketing.  

---

## 📈 Visual Highlights

Visuals were generated using `vip`, `ggplot2`, and `ggstatsplot` to support deep feature understanding and stakeholder presentations.

---

## 💼 Outcome

- ✅ Delivered a complete **churn prediction pipeline** in R.  
- 📦 Packaged the codebase for handoff to the client-side data engineering team.  
- 🧑‍💼 Presented results to consultants and client stakeholders with a focus on **business alignment** and **interpretability**.
