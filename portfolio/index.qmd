**Role:** Researcher \| Embedded Systems Developer \| Data Scientist\
**Technologies:** Arduino, R, Shiny, Proteus, DS18B20, BPW34, ggplot2, lubridate

A flagship research project focused on developing a low-cost, open-source solar cooker performance testing platform, built to comply with the ASAE S580.1 standard.

**Key components:**

-   📡 Sensor-based data acquisition using DS18B20 (temperature) and BPW34 (irradiance) via Arduino\
-   📊 Shiny web application for visualizing cooking power, standardizing results to 700 W/m², and modeling environmental/health benefits\
-   🛠️ Simulation & calibration using Proteus 8 Professional for validation prior to hardware deployment\
-   🌱 Impact-driven: Quantifies fuel savings, CO₂ reduction, and public health benefits for NGOs and field partners

This system empowers stakeholders in energy, development, and sustainability to perform affordable, standardized testing in low-resource settings.
