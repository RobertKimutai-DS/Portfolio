# 🌞 Solar Cooker Performance Testing Platform

![Solar Cooker System](../assets/images/solar_cooker_diagram.jpg){.img-fluid .rounded .shadow-sm .mb-4}

This project presents an **open-source, low-cost solar cooker testing system** aligned with the **ASAE S580.1** standard. It combines **sensor-based data acquisition**, **embedded electronics**, and a web-based **R Shiny dashboard** to standardize cooking power evaluation and quantify sustainability impacts.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In many low-resource settings, solar cooking solutions lack **affordable**, **standardized testing equipment**, making it hard to validate performance or compare cookers. Traditional lab-grade equipment is **cost-prohibitive**, excluding local NGOs and researchers.

---

## 🛠️ System Overview

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno (ATmega328P)
- **Sensors**:
  - DS18B20 digital temperature sensors for ambient and water temperature
  - BPW34 photodiode + PTFE cosine corrector for solar irradiance
- **Data Logging**:
  - SD Card module for timestamped logs
  - RTC DS3232 for accurate timekeeping
- **Display & Feedback**:
  - 20x4 I2C LCD for real-time display
  - HC-06 Bluetooth for wireless transmission

> The system reads, logs, and transmits temperature and irradiance data in real-time while calculating **cooking power** and standardizing it to 700 W/m² per ASAE S580.1.

## 💻 Shiny Dashboard

![Shiny Dashboard Screenshot](../assets/images/shiny_dashboard.jpg){.img-fluid .rounded .shadow-sm .mb-3}

The **R Shiny dashboard** provides:

- 📈 **Real-time data visualization**
- 📊 **Cooking power analysis**
- 🌿 **Sustainability metrics** (fuel savings, CO₂ emissions avoided, health impact proxy)
- 🧾 Downloadable reports in PDF or Excel

---

## 🔁 Simulation & Validation

To ensure accuracy and repeatability:

- **Proteus 8 Professional** was used to simulate DS18B20 and BPW34 sensor behavior
- **Potentiometers** emulated dynamic temperature and irradiance in real time
- System calibration ensured sensor readings aligned with empirical standards

---

## 🌍 Impact & Benefits

- ⚡ Empowers communities and NGOs to validate solar cooking technology affordably
- 🌱 Models environmental benefits (e.g., CO₂ reduction)
- 👩‍🔬 Supports academic and policy research through replicable, open-source methodology
